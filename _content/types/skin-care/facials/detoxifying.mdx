title: Detoxifying
description: >-
 A detoxifying facial is a type of facial that focuses on deep cleaning and purifying the skin. It typically includes a series of steps that help to remove impurities and toxins from the skin, leaving it looking and feeling refreshed. Our professional estheticians will then cleanse your skin and possibly use a gentle exfoliant to remove dead skin cells. They may use steaming or hot towels to open up pores for extractions (removal of blackheads or whiteheads). Then apply a mask or treatment that is designed to detoxify the skin, such as clay, charcoal, or mud mask. After the mask, the esthetician will apply a moisturizer or sunscreen to protect the skin.

 Some of the benefits of a detoxifying facial include deeply cleansing the skin and removing impurities and toxins while also moisturizing your face. It can also help to reduce the appearance of acne, wrinkles, blemishes, and pores, as well as improve the overall health of the skin.
