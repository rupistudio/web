title: Vitamin C Infusion
description: >-
  A Vitamin C facial is a cosmetic procedure that uses products containing Vitamin C to brighten and rejuvenate the skin. This opens up channels to penetrate deeper into the skin, to increase skinâ€™s collagen production to tighten, give fuller skin, and reduce wrinkle appearance. Vitamin C helps fight the aging of the skin, repair the damage caused by UV rays, and helps smoothen the skin. Our professional estheticians will then cleanse your skin and apply a Vitamin C serum or other products containing Vitamin C to the skin. The esthetician may also use a variety of other treatments such as gentle exfoliation, light therapy, a mask, or a gentle massage to boost the effectiveness of Vitamin C products.

  Some of the benefits of a vitamin c facial include reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, brightening skin tone and reducing the appearance of dark spots and blemishes, stimulating collagen production, providing antioxidant protection against environmental stressors and UV rays as well as improving the overall health of the skin.
