description: >-
  Pro-cell therapy is a non-invasive skin rejuvenating procedure that uses adult stem cells to revitalize the skin. Our estheticians will apply a serum that contains adult stem cells to the skin.

  Some of the benefits of Pro Cell Therapy include stimulating collagen reproduction, improving the skin texture and tone, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation while improving the overall health of the skin.
