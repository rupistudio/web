title: Micro Hydra
description: >-
  Microhydrafacial is a cosmetic procedure that combines the use of gentle microdermabrasion, chemical exfoliation, and hydration to improve the overall appearance and health of the skin. Our professional esthetician will then cleanse your skin, use a diamond tip wand to gently exfoliate the skin, apply a chemical exfoliant such as an alpha hydroxy acid or beta hydroxy acid, and infuse the skin with a hydrating serum or moisturizer.

  Some of the benefits associated with Microhydrafacials include providing hydration to the skin, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation, helping skincare products penetrate deeper into the skin, and improving the overall health of the skin and leaving you with glowing skin.
