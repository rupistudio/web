  A Gold facial is a type of cosmetic procedure that uses products containing gold to improve the overall appearance and health of the skin. Generally, there are 2 different types of gold facials. Gold Collagen facial and 24k Gold leaf facial. We combine both options to get the best benefits from both products to help in the reduction of wrinkles and fine lines making your skin look youthful. Our trained esthetician will then cleanse your skin and apply products that contain gold such as a gold leaf, gold serum, or gold mask. The treatment may include other steps such as gentle exfoliation, light therapy, or massage to enhance the effectiveness of the gold products.

  Some of the benefits of a gold facial include helping with improving blood circulation, brightening your face, helping with dullness from sun damage and it provides your skin with oxygen which makes you look less tired. It also is known to help stimulate collagen production, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, provide antioxidant protection against environmental stressors and improve the overall health of the skin.
