title: Soothing Back
description: >-
  Facial geared to oneâ€™s back where we exfoliate, apply steam treatment, remove blackheads, apply scrubs, and a mask to cleanse the skin and reduce dead cells on the back. A facial is a cosmetic procedure in which the skin on the face is cleaned, exfoliated, and moisturized. For the procedure, our trained Estheticians will then cleanse your skin and possibly use a gentle exfoliant to remove dead skin cells. They may use steaming or hot towels to open up pores for extractions (removal of blackheads or whiteheads). Then apply a mask or treatment that is suitable for the skin type. After the mask, the esthetician will apply a moisturizer or sunscreen to protect the skin. The benefits of a facial include cleansing the skin, reducing acne, and improving the overall health of the skin.
