description: >-
  A Skin Brightening facial is a type of cosmetic procedure that uses products and techniques to even out skin tone, reduce hyperpigmentation and improve overall skin radiance. Our professional esthetician will then cleanse your skin and apply products such as exfoliants, serums, and masks that contain ingredients such as Vitamin C, glycolic acid, kojic acid, and arbutin to brighten and even out the skin tone.

  Some of the benefits of a skin brightening facial include brightening the skin tone, reducing hyperpigmentation blemishes, and dark spots as well as improving the overall health of the skin, and giving your skin a natural radiance.
