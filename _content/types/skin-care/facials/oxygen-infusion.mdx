title: Oxygen Infusion
description: >-
  An Oxygen Infusion Facial is a type of cosmetic procedure that uses an oxygen machine and specialized products to infuse oxygen into the skin giving you skin the benefits of its anti-inflammatory properties. Oxygen facials increase collagen production by increasing cell turnover. Our professional esthetician will then cleanse your skin and apply a serum that contains active ingredients such as antioxidants and vitamins to the skin. The esthetician will then use the oxygen machine to infuse the serum into the skin, which can be done by spraying the serum or using a wand to deliver the oxygen.

  Some of the benefits of an oxygen infusion facial include brightening skin tone, stimulating collagen reproduction, providing antioxidant protection against environmental stressors and UV rays as well as improving the overall health of the skin.
