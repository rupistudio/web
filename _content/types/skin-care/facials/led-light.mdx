title: LED Light
description: >-
  An LED light facial is a cosmetic procedure that uses specific wavelengths of light to target various skin concerns including anti-aging, reducing inflammation, and increasing the amount of collagen in the skin to reduce the number of wrinkles on the skin. The procedure is also known to help with eczema, mild or moderate acne, rosacea, sun damage, and other benefits. Our professional estheticians will then cleanse your skin and apply a serum to the treatment area. Then we'll use a device that emits LED light at specific wavelengths to target specific skin concerns. Red light is used for reducing inflammation, blue light is used for treating acne, and yellow light is used for reducing redness.
