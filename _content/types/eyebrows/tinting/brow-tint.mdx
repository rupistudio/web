title: Brow Tint
description: >-
  Brow tinting is a cosmetic procedure in which a dye is applied to the eyebrows
  to enhance their color and shape. Our professional estheticians are trained to
  help you select the best color/shade for your look. Some of the benefits of
  eyebrow tinting include enhancing the overall appearance of the face, creating
  a more defined and shapely eyebrow, and saving time each morning by
  eliminating the need for daily brow filling.

    In some cases the dye used for the procedure may cause allergic reactions.
    Feel free to ask for a 'patch test' of the dye before the treatment to
    ensure no allergic reactions or other issues occur.
