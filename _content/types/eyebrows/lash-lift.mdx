  A Lash Lift is a cosmetic procedure that uses a solution and a silicone rod to
  lift and curl the natural lashes which gives the appearance of a fuller,
  thicker and healthier look without relying on chemicals.

  Some of the benefits include enhancing natural lashes making them appear
  longer and more curled as well as increasing the growth of lashes. The
  treatment will last up to 4-8 on average. Some of the benefits include

    In some cases, allergic reactions to the solution may occur. There may also
    be some irritation and redness around the skin of the eyebrows if your skin
    is very sensitive. Please let your esthetician know if you have any
    sensitive areas or are taking any medications that might affect the skin.
