title: Microdermabrasion
description: >-
  A microdermabrasion facial is a cosmetic procedure that uses a diamond-tipped
  wand or fine crystals to gently exfoliate the top layer of skin. The procedure
  is non-invasive and is used to exfoliate the skin and remove superficial
  layers of dry, dead skin cells. This also helps fight sun damage, fine lines,
  wrinkles, scars, rough skin texture and large pores, ingrown hair, and shaving
  rash. The procedure involves our professional esthetician who will then
  cleanse your skin and use a microdermabrasion wand to gently abrade the
  surface of the skin, removing dead skin cells and revealing smoother, brighter
  skin underneath. Some of the benefits of microdermabrasion include reducing
  the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improving the appearance of scars,
  and reducing the appearance of sun damage. It can also help to reduce the
  appearance of acne, blemishes, and pores, as well as improve the overall
  health of the skin.
