description: >-
  Lipo cavitation is a noninvasive procedure that uses ultrasound to break down
  fat cells. The fat cells are then naturally eliminated by the body. The
  procedure is painless and has no downtime. It is a great alternative to
  liposuction and is a great way to get rid of stubborn fat.
