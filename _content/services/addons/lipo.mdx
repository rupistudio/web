  Lipo cavitation is a noninvasive procedure that uses ultrasound to break down
  fat cells. The fat cells are then naturally eliminated by the body. The
  procedure is painless and has no downtime. It is a great alternative to
  liposuction and is a great way to get rid of stubborn fat. During the
  treatment, a trained esthetician uses a handheld device emitting ultrasonic
  waves that is applied to the area of the body being treated. The waves
  penetrate the skin and disrupt the fat cells, causing them to release their
  contents and be naturally eliminated by the body. Some of the benefits of Lipo
  Cavitation include the ability to target specific areas of the body, reduce
  the appearance of cellulite and can improve the overall appearance of the
  treated areas.
