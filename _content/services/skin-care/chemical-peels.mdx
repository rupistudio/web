title: Chemical Peels
description: >-
  A Chemical Peel is a type of cosmetic procedure that uses a chemical solution
  to remove the damaged outer layers of the skin. It is a type of chemical
  exfoliating that dissolves the bond between dead skin cells allowing them to
  easily wipe away to reveal smoother, younger, healthier-looking skin. Our
  trained esthetician will then cleanse your skin and apply the chemical
  solution to the skin. The solution is left on the skin for a specific amount
  of time, depending on the type of peel and the desired depth of the peel.
  After the solution is removed, the skin will be neutralized and moisturized.
disclaimer:
  - >-
    Chemical peels are not recommended for people with certain skin conditions,
    such as eczema, rosacea, or lupus. People with darker skin should not have
    chemical peels. If you are unsure if this procedure is right for you please
    feel free to speak with one of our estheticians who can help you find the
    procedure that works best for your skin.
