title: Threading
description: >-
  Brow threading is a procedure in which a thin cotton thread is used to remove
  unwanted hair from the eyebrows. Our trained Estheticians will use a thin
  cotton thread to twist and pull the hair out at the roots. Carefully ensuring
  that the skin is not pulled or damaged. The Esthetician will then use tweezers
  and scissors to trim and shape the eyebrows to the desired look.


  Some of the benefits of brow threading include: creating a more defined and
  shapely eyebrow, removing unwanted hair, and saving time each morning by
  eliminating the need for daily brow grooming since threading results lsat
  longer than simply using tweezers. In some cases, where the skin is very
  sensitive, the procedure may cause some redness and irritation around the skin
  of the eyebrows.

    In some cases, depending on the sensitivity of your skin, you may experience
    redness or irritation. This is normal and will subside within a few hours.
