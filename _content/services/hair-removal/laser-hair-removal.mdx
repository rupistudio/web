description: >
  Laser hair removal effectively removes unwanted hair through exposure to the
  pulse of laser light that destroys the hair follicle. The effect lasts for
  several months or it might last for a year. When hair regrows, it is usually
  finer and lighter in color. Our trained estheticians will cleanse the area to
  be treated and apply a cooling gel to the skin. The laser will then be passed
  over the skin to target the hair follicles. The laser will emit a pulse of
  light that is absorbed by the pigment in the hair follicle. The heat energy
  from the laser will then destroy the hair follicle and prevent it from growing
  back.

    IIn some cases, allergic reactions to the solution may occur. There may also
    be some irritation and redness around the skin of the eyebrows if your skin
    is very sensitive. Please let your esthetician know if you have any
    sensitive areas or are taking any medications that might affect the skin. If
    you have certain conditions, such as a history of keloid scarring, you may
    not be a suitable candidate for laser hair removal. If these warnings apply
    to you please consult with your doctor before booking a treatment.

    There is an additional charge of a minimum of $25 if we are required to
    shave any area prior to service.
